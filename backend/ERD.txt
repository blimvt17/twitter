Relationships describe how the entities are related to each other. 
For example, a student might be enrolled in multiple courses, or a teacher might teach multiple courses.
Relationships: 
User can create many tweets (one-to-many)
Tweet can have many hashtags (many-to-many)

Create the diagram: Once you have identified the entities, relationships, and attributes, you can create the ERD. 
There are many tools you can use to create an ERD, including software such as Lucidchart or draw.io, or you can draw it by hand.

Refine the diagram: Once you have created the ERD, review it to make sure it accurately represents your system. 
You may need to make adjustments to the diagram to ensure it is clear and easy to understand.
